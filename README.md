# Amulet MVP - UI

## Overview

Amulet is a geolocalized application with strong focus on traveling people, we want to create a gamificated conduct-based application for traveling and user commuting. We want to implement a new social network design, based on the user interaction with virtual objects.

## Objective

To create an Minimal Value Product (MVP) this will be  functional prototype that will be a functional prototype for further analysis.

We want to create an application wich will create value through the combination of several technologies: DB, Middleware, Web Application, Mobile Application, Mapping, AR and other technologies.

## Specifications

The mobile application will feature a mal, wich will show the user sorroundings, in the time, the map will show tha items (tridimentional object), wich the user will be able to get close and add them to his inventory.

If the user have an item on his inventory, the user will be able to add tags, text, video or images to the object.

This object can be left on the map, so another user will be able to pick it up and add more stories (tags, text, vide or images);

the user will be able to pass the owned items to another user near the actual location.
